# Rules of the Game :
The game is to be played between two people. It is played on a 3x3 grid. One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells. The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character (‘O’ or ‘X’).
